Comparison: CGI vs. Servlets
CGI (Common Gateway Interface) and Servlets are both used for creating dynamic web applications, but Servlets offer several advantages over CGI.

CGI creates a new process for each user request, which makes it slow and resource-intensive. In contrast, Servlets run inside a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and handle multiple requests using threads instead of processes, making them much more efficient.

In terms of performance, CGI programs consume more memory and CPU resources because each request spawns a separate process. Servlets, however, run as single instances handling multiple requests via threads, significantly reducing resource consumption.

Scalability is another major advantage of Servlets. Since CGI creates a new process for every request, it does not scale well under heavy traffic. Servlets, on the other hand, can efficiently handle thousands of requests without excessive resource usage.

CGI is also platform-dependent, as it often relies on system-specific scripting languages like Perl or Python. Servlets, being Java-based, are platform-independent and can run on any system with a JVM.

Security is another area where Servlets excel. Since CGI scripts run as separate system processes, they can be vulnerable to various security risks. Servlets operate within a controlled Java environment, making them more secure.

Finally, maintenance and code reusability are much better in Servlets. Java provides built-in support for session tracking, database connectivity, and HTTP handling, whereas CGI scripts require additional effort to implement these features.
